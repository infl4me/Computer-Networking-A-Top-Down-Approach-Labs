## Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Labs Repository

Current repository contains my solutions for labs of the Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach [book](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/about.php). [Assigments](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/programming.php)

## Completed programming labs:
- **Socket programming.** A simple client/server socket program
- **Webserver.** A simple Web server that is capable of processing only one request
- **UDP pinger.** A client ping program
- **SMTP (Mail client).** A simple mail client that sends e-mail to any recipient
- **Web Proxy.** A simple web proxy server with caching
- **Reliable Transport Protocol.** Sending and receiving transport-level code for implementing a simple reliable data transfer protocol

## Completed wireshark labs:
- **HTTP.** In this lab, we’ll explore several aspects of the HTTP protocol: the basic GET/reply interaction, HTTP message formats, retrieving large HTML files, retrieving HTML files with embedded URLs, persistent and non-persistent connections, and HTTP authentication and security
- **DNS.** In this lab, we take a closer look at the client side of the DNS, the protocol that
translates Internet hostnames to IP addresses
- **TCP.** Analyzing the client- and server-side traces to explore aspects of TCP
- **UDP.** In this short lab, you’ll do a packet capture and analysis of your favorite application that uses UDP
- **IP.** In this lab, we’ll investigate the celebrated IP protocol, focusing on the IPv4 and IPv6 datagram

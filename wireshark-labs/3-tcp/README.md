In this lab, you’ll use your Web browser to access a file from a Web server. As in earlier Wireshark labs, you’ll use Wireshark to capture the packets arriving at your computer. Unlike earlier labs, you’ll also be able to download a Wireshark-readable packet trace from the Web server from which you downloaded the file. In this server trace, you’ll find the packets that were generated by your own access of the Web server. You’ll analyze the client- and server-side traces to explore aspects of TCP.

In particular, you’ll evaluate the performance of the TCP connection between your computer and the Web server. You’ll trace TCP’s window behavior, and infer packet loss, retransmission, flow control and congestion control behavior, and estimated roundtrip time.

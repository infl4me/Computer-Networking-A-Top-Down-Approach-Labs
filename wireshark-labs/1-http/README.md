## HTTP Wireshark Lab

Having gotten our feet wet with the Wireshark packet sniffer in Lab 1, we’re now ready to use Wireshark to investigate protocols in operation. In this lab, we’ll explore several aspects of the HTTP protocol: the basic GET/reply interaction, HTTP message formats, retrieving large HTML files, retrieving HTML files with embedded URLs, persistent and non-persistent connections, and HTTP authentication and security. As is the case with all Wireshark labs, the full description of this lab is available at this book’s Web site, www.pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources.

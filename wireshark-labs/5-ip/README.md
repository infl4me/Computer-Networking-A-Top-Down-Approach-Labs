In this lab, we’ll investigate the celebrated IP protocol, focusing on the IPv4 and IPv6 datagram.

This lab has three parts:
 - In the first part, we’ll analyze packets in a trace of IPv4 datagrams sent and received by the traceroute program
 - We’ll study IP fragmentation in Part 2 of this lab
 - and take a quick look at IPv6 in Part 3 of this lab
